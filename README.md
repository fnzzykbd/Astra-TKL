# Astra TKL
This is a keyboard design I've made in 2023. It's called Astra because I like space stuff. Top mount WKL TKL, 8Â° typing angle, 17mm front height (~18mm on inner edge, ~19mm with bumpons). The intended purpose was to make a one-off and then release it to the public once ready. The one-off had a few kinks, however, and another proto means spending more money.

This release includes the original prototyped design with one tweak (see design history), a fully updated design that would've been the second protoype (one day!) and naturally, since this is an open source release, the Fusion 360 .f3d source files with complete history for both versions.

Feel free to use the files to your hearts content in accordance with the license. I am not liable for anything, files are provided as is.

And since I am a curious fellow, if you do something with these files and order something, would be cool to let me know on Discord @fnzzy.

DESIGN HISTORY

Prototype was made with top mount + O-ring mount. Case bottom design didn't allow for the O-ring to work, forgot to check. My bad. The prototype had a ping issue due to a slightly warped top case, so I've used it with either the four corner screws only or with heavy force break. Doing either made it sound great.

Provided prototype files have the O-ring mount removed, since it didn't work, everything else is unchanged.

Provided updated design also removed the four centre screws as those made the prototype ping and didn't contribute to the assembly in any critical way. Some internal radii on the weight and the surrounding dish have been changed. Cable channel has been widened and chamfer adjusted to match with other internal chamfers. The updated design has not yet been prototyped.

The keyboard has been designed around and proven to work with the [Lysol XYZ DBoard](https://github.com/lyso1/Lysol-XYZ-DBoard) and the [daji Otus Engineering 87.5 1.2mm PCB](https://dajikeyboards.com/products/otus-engineering-87-5-pcb). If you're using another PCB, please make sure it fits.

Special thanks to ankit for providing me with free daughterboards to use with this board. Absolute legend considering that I am a complete stranger to him.
